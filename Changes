    bug #81630 again)

0.3.8
  - Messages respect order of user options (fixes RT bug #81630)
  - Show --man and --usage in help message
  - Prevent a trailing whitespace in --help usage string

0.3.7
  - Fixed too enthusiastic variable interpolation in Euclid specs (RT bug #78854)
  - Fixed bug tracker URL (credits to Kent Fredric)

0.3.6
  - Fixed occasional non-minimized entry when using :minimal_keys specifier

0.3.5

  - Better handling of quoted arguments (RT bug #49525, reported by Ken Galinsky)

0.3.4
  - New standard argument --podfile to write the manual in a .pod file
  - Fixed issue where the NAME and VERSION sections appeared as a verbatim
    section (which podchecker complains about)
  - Always convert POD to text when calling help() and man()
  - help() is now paged if IO::Pager::Page is installed
  - Dependency changes:
      Pod::Simple::Text replaces Pod::Text
      Pod::Simple::Text is required instead of recommended,
      IO::Pager::Page is recommended

0.3.3
  - Attempt to extract POD even from files that look binary (might be packaged
    with pp, perlapp or similar program)

0.3.2
  - Another attempt to make the CPAN indexer happy

0.3.1
  - Changed $VERSION to make the CPAN indexer happy
  - Export repeatable options with multiple placeholders as an empty arrayref,
    not as an empty hashref (RT bug #71165, reported by Bill Levering)

0.3.0
  - Reverted feature to match POD head section =head2, =head3 and =head4 because
    of backward compatibility issue (RT bug #70942)

0.2.9  2011-09-03
  - This command does not generate warnings anymore:
    perl -e 'use Getopt::Euclid; print $Getopt::Euclid::VERSION;'
  - Required and optional arguments can now be put in a POD head section =head2,
    =head3 and =head4 for more flexibility

0.2.8  2011-09-02
  - Support for optional defaults (RT bug #61438, patch from Paolo Medeo)
  - Extended the grammar of recognized POD headers for required and optional arguments:
    [STANDARD|STD|PROGRAM|SCRIPT|CLI|COMMAND[-| ]LINE] [REQUIRED|MANDATORY] [PARAM|PARAMETER|ARG|ARGUMENT][S]
    [STANDARD|STD|PROGRAM|SCRIPT|CLI|COMMAND[-| ]LINE]      OPTION[AL|S]    [PARAM|PARAMETER|ARG|ARGUMENT][S]
  - Usage error message now mentions the --man option in addition to --help

0.2.7
  - Updated dependencies in Build.PL module

0.2.6
  - Bugfix: corrected a .pod file finding issue

0.2.5
  - Bugfix for #69324: more efficient and accurate POD extraction using Perl::Tidy
  - Bugfix for #29301: automatically looking for POD located into .pod files
  - Bugfix for #69105: file META.yml states which license the module uses
  - Bugfix for #34200: variables in constraint specifications are read as
    originating from the 'main' package namespace
  - Little internal modification to prevent identical placeholders that are
    present multiple times in the specification to be processed multiple times.
  - Error messages for arguments that do not validate against the constraints
    now display the value of variables instead of their name.

0.2.4
  - Default values can now be specified in the POD and displayed in the program
    documentation
  - Support for more integer arguments, e.g. scientific notation like 1E8
  - Support for arguments that cannot coexist using the 'exclude' keyword
  - New specifier to defer processing of @ARGV arguments: :defer
  - New method to pass an arbitrary array of arguments to parsing: process_args
  - New methods to access the program usage, version, manual and help messages
  - When a version number is missing from the POD or $main::VERSION, the file
    time and date are used as version number
  - The help message now includes --version and is more consistent with the
    usage message
  - Bugfix: the options in the help message are no longer randomly sorted
  - Bugfix: the man page is now properly formed when .pm files that have no POD
    are use'd
  - Bugfix: when the --man flag was passed and the script name was, e.g. 'myprog'
    instead of 'myprog - short description', an undef warning was issued
  - Bugfix: when the --help flag was passed and either no required arguments or
    no optional arguments were specified in the POD, an undef warning was issued
  - Bugfix: the POD parsing mechanism now removes rogue PODs hidden inside
    variables and other Perl-quoted strings
  - Bugfix for #34195: addresses compatibility with Perl compiling (syntax check)
  - Bugfix for #34207: .type.error is now taken into account properly
  - Bugfix for #38461: file path that uses the volume and dir
  - Bugfix for #34199: new subroutine _check_name() verifies that argument name
    specifications are well-balanced with <> brackets

  - #55259 - created $SCRIPT_VERSION variable containing parsed version
  - #61039 - don't insert default value for options with optional placeholders
             where the flag is given but a value for the placeholder is not
